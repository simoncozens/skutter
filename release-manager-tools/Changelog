* Songbee will notify you when new versions are available and help you to
  upgrade.

* Songbee can now display Bible passages from SBB (SongBee Bible) files.

   import your own SBB files.
 : The SBB Bible format also supports Japanese Bibles like the
   Shinkayaku version, if you know where to get one from...

* Various visual fixes have been made to the projector display,
  including hanging indents on long lines.
  : On the console display, each part of the song also displays the
    accelerator key to jump to it.

* You can view and save a report of how many times each song has been
  sung, for copyright purposes.

* A pretty new icon!

* The in-worship searching facility has been improved:
 : The preview pane is kept up to date with the best matched song.
 : Pressing enter will insert the selected item.
 : Ctrl-F (command-F on OS X) will jump to the find bar.

* An "About" box displays the Songbee version and the version of the XUL
  platform.

* Minor fixes:
 : You can no longer create playlists with blank names.
 : Updated build numbers and version numbers everywhere.
 : The "edit playlist" page again resizes properly.
 : Metadata attributes added to songs are forced into lower case.
 : Right-clicking on a metadata attribute has a "delete" option in the menu. 
 : When a song is deleted, the preview window is emptied.

What's new in Songbee 2.0

* Songbee not only supports songs, but is now extensible to allow display 
  of other kinds of material: Bible passages, web sites, and so on.

* Two such extensions are currently part of Songbee:
  : If you are online, Bible passages will be displayed from the online
    ESV. This is a proof-of-concept until we have sorted out Bible
    licensing.
  : You can add a web site address into a playlist and have the site appear
    on the projector.

* You can add any additional "annotations" to a song that you like - for
  instance, the hymnal name and hymn number. Future versions will allow
  you to search on this data.

* When one song is marked as a translation of another, the option is
  given during worship to switch between translations of the current song.

* You can change the style (background, colours, etc.) of individual playlists.

* The menus have been rearranged to make creating new types of material easier.

* On the "edit playlist" window, you can now drag songs from the library
  into your playlist.

* Fix problem where databases were getting locked and could no longer be
  modified.

* Fix problem where the "edit playlist" window was coming up empty.

* The default display now has its text nearer the top edge of the projector;
  verse text is also centered on the screen.
